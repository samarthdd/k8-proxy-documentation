## GW SPO Extension Administration

### Configure Hide Download Extension Solution
SharePoint Online keeps tenant-wide extension details in a List called, "Tenant Wide Extensions" on App Catalog Site.
For Hide-Download-Extension, we keep following two properties which can be configured:
    1. CommandName: This is the comma separated values of all the possible values of attribute 'data-automationid' of HTML controls. We use it to track the download button on the page.
    2. ExecuteFrequency: The is numeric value which defines the frequency interval at which the extension checks for download buttons on page and hides it.

### Steps to update Hide Download Extension Properties
The default values are already configured however if we would like to customize, we can update them as follows:
- Navigate to App Catalog Site on your tenant (i.e. https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/apps).
- Click on 'Site contents' in the Left Navigation.

- Make sure you ONLY update highlighted values as follows and keep the JSON format as it is:
    * {"commandName":"<b><i>download,downloadCommand</i></b>","executeFrequency":<b><i>300</i></b>}
  
- Please note that the changes to the list will be applied to the extension on your tenant in 2 to 24 hours.
